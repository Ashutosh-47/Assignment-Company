MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJs, ReactJs, and NodeJs) Project.

I created the app to be fully responsive.

1. New user has to sign up  and able to register via email, name, and password. , and an already existing user can directly log in. User email already exist can register again.

2. After logging in, the logout button will appear, and you can log out as well.

3.  After login user should be able to see personal details on the main page, including email, name, and password.

4. The user can change the name and password by clicking on the EDIT button, and to save the change, click on the Save button.




To make my code more readable and efficient, I used the useContext hook to make variables more accessible.
